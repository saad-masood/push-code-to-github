# push-code-to-github


Easy to follow steps, git pull origin master or main will give fatal: Couldn't find remote ref main so below steps will work just fine.

git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
